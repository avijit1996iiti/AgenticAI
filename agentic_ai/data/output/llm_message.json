    "Making black tea is a straightforward process. Here are the simple steps:\n\n1. **Boil Water**: Start by boiling fresh, filtered water. The quality of the water can affect the taste of your tea.\n\n2. **Pre-warm the Teapot/Cup (optional)**: Pour a little of the boiling water into your teapot or cup to warm it up, then discard the water.\n\n3. **Add Tea Leaves or Tea Bag**:\n   - **Loose Leaf**: Use approximately 1 teaspoon of black tea leaves per cup or more if you prefer a stronger flavor.\n   - **Tea Bag**: Use one tea bag per cup.\n\n4. **Pour Water**: Pour the boiling water over the tea leaves or bag. The water should be just off the boil, generally around 200-212\u00b0F (about 93-100\u00b0C).\n\n5. **Steep the Tea**: Let the tea steep. The steeping time can vary depending on your taste preference and the type of black tea you are using, but generally, 3 to 5 minutes is a good starting point.\n\n6. **Remove Tea Leaves/Bag**: Once the tea has steeped to your liking, remove the tea leaves or tea bag to prevent it from becoming too bitter.\n\n7. **Serve**: Pour the tea into your cup. You can drink it plain or add milk, sugar, honey, or lemon according to your preference.\n\n8. **Enjoy**: Sip and enjoy your freshly brewed black tea!",
